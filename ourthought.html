                            <p>Living creatures on earth are very diverse. We can even see the difference of living creatures in one species. These differences lead to the biodiversity. According to Priadi (2010:126) biodiversity is a whole variation of living creatures, both form, appearance, number, and nature that can be found at the level of genes, species, or ecosystem levels. </p>
                            <p>According to Mien A. Rifai (2004) The term flora and ecosystem have the following meanings. Flora has two meanings, namely: (1) The whole species of plants on a habitat, area or geological; (2) Works or publications containing the list and the logging of species (types) of vegetation of a particular habitat, region or geological strata. While the ecosystem is the whole formation of living creatures (biomes) and their places of life.</p>
                            <p>Geographically, Indonesia is located on the equator,between the two continents, Asia and Australia; between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean; and two zoogeographical areas, Orientalis and Australis. Indonesia is also located between two young mountain ranges, Circum-Pacific and Circum-Mediteranian. As a result, Indonesia has so many volcanoes that the land becomes very fertile. Based on the astronomic location, Indonesia is located at 6° NL - 11° SL dan 95° EL - 141° EL, resulting tropical climate with high temperature, which is between 26°C - 28°C and rainfall is about 700-7000 mm per year. This causes the soil to be fertile enough because the rocks weathering process takes place quickly. Its strategic location causes Indonesia to have many variations of abiotic environment and biotic environment. Total land area of Indonesia reaches 2 million km2 and the sea area reaches 6 million km2, causing Indonesia to have at least 42 different ecosystems and included in one of the areas of mega biodiversity because it has biodiversity Very large. Indonesia has 17% of bird species, 16% amphibians and reptiles, 12% of mammals and 10% of all species in the earth. Some of them are endemic because they exist only in the territory of Indonesia and are not found in any other region of the world. Examples include Rafflesia arnoldi and Amorphophallus titanum or known as carcasses, Anoa, Komodo dragons, Maleo birds, and bird of paradise. There are several factors that can cause a country to be referred to as a megabiodiversity area such as regions located in the equator, tropical or subtropical climates, having at least 5.000 endemic types of plants and has many Forest.</p>
                            <p>The forest is a large area dominated by trees. In the forest grows a variety of plants that grow on this vast land, causing a very abundant biodiversity that creates a chain of life that cannot be released and intertwined with one another. Forest is a dominant ecosystem in the terrestrial regions of the earth.</p>
                            <p>Indonesia is the number two country in the world after Brazil which has the highest diversity and the widest third number in the world that has tropical rainforest. Indonesia's contribution reaches 16.7% of the world's biodiversity. Most of Indonesia is a tropical rainforest with a very high plant diversity so it is called Flora Malesiana. The Malesiana region covers many countries, namely the Malay Peninsula, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea.</p>
                            <p>Whitmore (1986) emphasized that the richest tropical rainforest has more than 200 species of trees with a chest-height diameter of ≥ 10 cm per hectare. Such plots are present in Asia, although some are also found in tropical America.  In Indonesia, such plots are found in Kalimantan. Indonesia's richest plot is the forest plot of Malinau, East Kalimantan, which contains 205 species of trees with a density of 759 in one hectare (Sheil et al. 2010). </p>
                            <p>Forests are home to many living creatures. In Kalimantan, Forest is a place of life for orangutans that are now reducing in number of population. In the Sumatra, forest is a place of life for Sumatran Tigers and two-LEED rhinos. In Java, Forest is a place of life for the one-tailed rhinoceros. In Sulawesi, Forest is a place of life for endemic animals. As well as in Papua, Forest is a place of life for Australis fauna. In addition forest is also a place of life for various plants. All of these are scattered and separated by the Wallace line and Weber line.</p>
                            <p>Forest is a place of primary need for living beings, especially humans. Humans cannot live without oxygen, and forests provide large amounts of oxygen to meet the needs of human life. Therefore the forest is also known as the lungs of the world. Forest is also a source of economics for humans. Forest-generated commodities which have a number of values so that they can be sold by humans.</p>
                            <p>Forest is a water catchment areas. Many trees in the forest cause a lot of roots that play in holding water so that there is no flood and erosion.</p>
                            <p>Maintaining forest continuity is very important, knowing the fact that forests are one of the ecosystems that contain a wide range of flora and fauna that causes a lot of biological diversity in the world, especially in Indonesia. But human activity at this time can lead to natural destruction resulting in reduced biodiversity. </p>
                            <p>Forest fires are the most common occurrence in the dry season. But there are ignorant hands that deliberately burn the forest to open new land without spending large costs. Because of the greedy hands, the nature shows its anger.</p>
                            <p>Currently known, forest fires in some areas of Indonesia is expanding. Based on data from the Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana (BNPB), the vast area of forest and land fires in Indonesia, in the period January – August 2019, reached 328,724 hectares. Riau Province is the largest area that has suffered forest fires that reach 49,266 hectares followed by central Kalimantan covering an area of 44,769 hectares. This fire also caused thick haze. Even Malaysia and Singapore claim to receive haze from Indonesia. </p>
                            <p>With the claim and complaint it is obvious that the state of Indonesia will become what it is in the eyes of ASEAN countries. According to Rusmadya Maharuddin (2019), the Indonesian government in 2012 has ratified the agreement on Haze Pollution (AHP) and in 2015 they have submitted the document of ratification. Thus Indonesia was entered into the treaty. One of the core agreements in article 9 is forest fire control that potentially inflict cross-border pollution. One of his efforts by promoting the mechanisms of national law. Finally again our oversight and enforcement of law is tested to prevent the forest fire itself. Related to complaints from neighboring countries, they should be a trigger for Indonesia to be more seriously complete the fires.</p>
                            <p>Often there are some who have been blackened by the climate change. Whereas there are often some persons who often do land clearing that can produce loose emissions and can damage the environment. Statistical Data shows that the rate of reduction of forest area in Sumatra reaches 2% per year, in Java reaches 0.42% per year, in Kalimantan reaches 0.94% per year, in Sulawesi reaches 1% per year, and in Papua reaches 0.7% per year. This has been due to the process of declining forest quality and deforestation so as to reduce biodiversity.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, we must maintain the forest to keep the forest sustainable. There have been many efforts in the prevention of forest damage that occurred in Indonesia. The business that has been done in Indonesia, among others, is building in situ and ex situ conservation, general natural protection such as building national parks, and protection of nature with a specific purpose, namely forest protection involving protection of land, water, and climate. Moreover, the Government also issued a Presidential decree No. 4 1993 on the determination of plant species and national animals.</p>
                            <p>Supervision and enforcement in forest protection should be improved. One of the weak forest protection efforts is from the supervision and enforcement side. It is necessary to have a really serious effort to protect the forest because it is flammable. </p>
                            <p>The presence of global environmental organizations in Indonesia, such as Greenpeace, also helped in preserving forest sustainability. Greenpeace is a global environmental organization campaigning for the termination of environmental destruction, one of them is deforestation. With these organizations it is hoped that the Community is increasingly aware of the importance of maintaining the environment and can participate in maintaining and stopping environmental damage.</p>
