                        <p>The biggest and the most evil threat don’t come from the animals, but from us humans. Their habitats keep decreasing from year to year. It’s hard to live in such a tight place with no things to discover for eat and fulfill the daily needs. In our 20 years of life, Orangutans have lost 80% of their territories. So by that, many if them finally came around the nearby village looking for foods. The result? Most of them burnt by villagers.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        
                        <p>Humans threat them far worse the the actual predators. For example, when the mother orangutan came to the village with her own child, the mother will be killed and the childling will be sold in the black market. This problem of open land policy, conversion, and also the illegal trading make the extinction of Orangutans will come close in near future.
                        </p>   
                        <br/>
                        
                        <p>The illegal lodging also has the most important aspect in Orangutans extinction. In the year of 2000, Indonesia lost 2,6 hectares of its forest. The signs of lost can not be traced by any way. So with 5 years passing, they finally discover that the forest has lost lots of hectares within only few years. At least 1,7 hectares forest lost due to the illegal lodging and open land policy.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        
                        <p>Usually they “erased” those wide areas to change them into gardens or farms. People in the village usually did that thing, sadly without thinking about the other habitats. Beside those things about policy and demography, the other thing that still be a highest threat is the illegal hunting. You know, there’s Indonesian strict rules about hunting, catching, or trading the wild rare animals, like Orangutan.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        
                        <p>The forest police of Indonesia keep this threat to be low as possible by doing some patrols into the wild areas of the forest. Usually they take “action” to the culprit who did those vile things. The culprit will be charged with some serious penalties by the judge. But, even though the rules are pretty clear, many people still do the hunting until this very time.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        
                        <p>Like we saw in social medias, many irresponsible people in Indonesia still hunt these poor things and showed them to the world by uploading the pictures of the dead animals. But moments after, they’ve got caught anyway by the police and Indonesian army.</p>
